# MifosX Community App

This is the default web application built on top of the MifosX platform for the mifos user community. It is a Single-Page App (SPA) written in web standard technologies like JavaScript, CSS and HTML5. It leverages common popular frameworks/libraries such as AngularJS, Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

## Building from source

1. Ensure you have ```npm``` installed - goto http://nodejs.org/download/ to download installer for your OS.       
<br/> Note: On Ubuntu Linux you can use 'sudo apt-get install npm nodejs-legacy' (nodejs-legacy is required to avoid the ""/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory" problem). 
<br/> Tip: If you are using Ubuntu/Linux, then doing ```npm config set prefix ~``` prevents you from having to run npm as root.

1. Clone this repository to your local filesystem (default branch is 'develop')

1. To download the dependencies, and be able to build, first install bower & grunt
   ```
    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g grunt-cli
   ```

1. Next pull the runtime and build time dependencies by running bower and npm install commands on the project root folder

   ```
    bower install
   ```
   ```
    npm install 
   ```

1. To preview the app, run the following command on the project root folder

   ```
    grunt serve
   ```
   or open the 'index.html' file in FIREFOX browser

   Note: If you see a warning similar to the one shown below on running `grunt serve` , try increasing the number of open files limit as per the suggestions at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34588/how-do-i-change-the-number-of-open-files-limit-in-linux/ 

   ```
    Waiting...Warning: EMFILE, too many open files

   ```

1. Default username/password: mifos/password. This application will hit the demo server by default.

You are done.

### Connecting to a MifosX Platform using OAuth 2 authentication:

Edit the value of property "security" in <a href="https://github.com/openMF/community-app/blob/develop/app/scripts/modules/configurations.js#L6">configurations.js</a> to "oauth"

### Connecting to a MifosX Platform running on a different host:

By default, when the app is running from the local filesystem, it will connect to the platform (mifosng-provider REST API) deployed on demo.openmf.org.

The app connects to the platform running on the same host/port when deployed on a server.

If you want to connect to the API running elsewhere, then append the baseApiUrl and tenantIdentifier as query parameters,

e.g. http://localhost:9000/?baseApiUrl=https://localhost:8443&tenantIdentifier=default

e.g. http://localhost:9000/?baseApiUrl=https://demo.openmf.org&tenantIdentifier=default
## Adding dependencies

You can also add more dependencies on bower.json. 
You can search for them in http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/ or even:

```
bower search <package>
```

## Running grunt tasks

Grunt tasks are used to automate repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, production builds, etc

Following are the tasks integrated.

### Validate JS and HTML files

Validate the JS files to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code. All errors output will be written to jshint-log.xml file which get created under project base directory.
Checks the markup validity of HTML files. All errors output will be written to console.

```
grunt validate
```

### Build

Build the code for production deployment.

```
grunt prod
```

### Serve

Use this for development.
Start a static server and open the project in the default browser. The application will hit the demo server.

```
grunt serve
```

## Running the tests

Just open test/SpecRunner.html in the browser.
